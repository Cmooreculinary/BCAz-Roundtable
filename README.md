## Deploy to Render

```bash
# 1. Set environment variables (see backend/.env.example)
# 2. Connect repo to Render — render.yaml handles both services

# Required env vars:
# SQLITE_PATH, JWT_SECRET, CORS_ORIGINS, UPLOAD_ROOT
# Optional: VAPID keys, TWILIO creds, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (Smart Suggestions)
```

The `render.yaml` at the repo root defines both the backend (Python web service) and frontend (static site). SQLite and uploads are configured under `/opt/data`, backed by a Render persistent disk on the backend service. Render persistent disks require a paid web service; without the disk, local file changes are ephemeral across deploys/restarts.
